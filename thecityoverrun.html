        NEW YORK CITY, N.Y. -- Across the world's most densely populated cities, something remarkable happens when human presence fades: nature slowly begins to take over. In places like New York City, where every inch of space is highly valued, vacant lots, abandoned buildings, and unkept public spaces transform into surprising displays of overgrowth. What may begin as cracks in the sidewalk sprouting weeds, or ivy creeping up the sides of dilapidated buildings, can soon morph into entire urban landscapes reclaimed by greenery. These forgotten spaces, once symbols of human dominance, have now been overtaken by vines, trees, and wildlife. Though many view these overgrown areas as eyesores or signs of neglect, there's an unexpected beauty in the fusion of natural growth with man-made environments.
        </p>
        <p>
        This urban overgrowth doesn’t just happen in forgotten neighborhoods. In fact, even Manhattan, the most urbanized borough, has its share of nature's quiet persistence. Weeds spring up through cracks in city streets, abandoned lots turn into impromptu green spaces, and buildings left without maintenance slowly become engulfed by plants.</p>
            <p class="pullquote">"The result is an unintentional but striking display of resilience—a reminder that despite the dominance of steel and concrete, nature finds a way to thrive."</p>
        <p>
        From an environmental perspective, these overgrown spaces provide critical habitats for insects, birds, and other wildlife that find refuge in the untamed parts of the city. They also offer a reprieve from the sterile, hyper-controlled landscapes that dominate urban life, giving residents a glimpse into how the world might look if left to nature’s course. The beauty in these spaces lies not in their perfection, but in their raw, untamed growth—a chaotic yet harmonious dance between human-made structures and the natural world.
        </p>
        <p>
        In cities like New York, where green space is often limited to carefully planned parks and gardens, these spontaneous pockets of nature remind us of the ongoing balance between urban development and the natural environment. The overgrown buildings and lots serve as a testament to nature's quiet but steady ability to reclaim its place in the world, even in the heart of bustling metropolises.

    <h3>NYC urged to address abandoned, overgrown ‘filthy, disgusting’ Staten Island eyesore</h3>

        STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- An abandoned, partially collapsed home that’s been unoccupied for more than a decade is now completely covered in overgrown weeds, morphing into an unsightly blight on the Great Kills community.
        </p>
        <p>
        The property, located at 12 Cornish St., has drawn the ire of others in the neighborhood, with the building itself now nearly indistinguishable from the weeds and vines that have engulfed it in recent years.

        Students moving in with seniors: an alternative solution to the housing crisis</p>
        <p class="pullquote">“It is completely collapsed and overgrown with trees and weeds. More than that, it is absolutely filthy, disgusting and filled with litter and other objects. It’s a very unsanitary situation and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was also a breeding ground for mosquitoes in the summertime,”</p>
        <p>said one neighbor who request anonymity.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
        The home was last inspected by the city Department of Buildings in February 2022 in response to a neighbor’s 311 complaint claiming that the house had fallen into a state of disrepair.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the time, inspectors noted that the building’s roof and a section of the wall had partially collapsed, exposing the home’s interior to the elements.
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite these findings, inspectors deemed that the building did not pose an immediate hazard to the public and elected not to issue an emergency demolition order, which [is] only issued when a building is “at imminent risk of collapse,” according to a Buildings Department spokesperson.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, the spokesperson said the department is currently working to schedule an inspector to visit the property again, at which point additional information about the building’s future will be made available.
        </p>
        <p>
        Officials noted that following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the building was marked with a red placard by the Buildings Department, meaning that it was unsafe to enter and repairs must be made before it could be occupied again.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, those repairs were never made and the listed owner of the house in city records, Philip Powles, who would be responsible for making those fixes, is deceased.
        </p>
        <p>
        The burden of repairs would typically fall to the deceased’s estate or heirs, but city records indicate no change in ownership since Powles’ passing.

    <h3>The Science of Overgrowth</h3>
    <h4>(Sep 16, 2024)</h4>
    <h4>By Rosa de Vera</h4>

        When human activity ceases, nature seizes the opportunity to reclaim its territory. The overgrowth that spreads across abandoned spaces is not a random occurrence but a biological and ecological process known as succession. In this process, plants and fungi gradually establish themselves in environments left vacant by human activity, often creating thriving ecosystems where there was once urban sprawl. This transformation is not just a sign of neglect but a manifestation of nature’s resilience and adaptability.
        </p><p>
        Ecological succession begins with hardy pioneer species like mosses, lichens, and certain grasses, which are capable of growing in the harsh, nutrient-poor conditions found in abandoned urban environments. These early colonizers stabilize the environment, breaking down concrete, stone, and other man-made materials, slowly creating more hospitable conditions for other species to follow. Over time, vines such as ivy and kudzu, and larger shrubs and trees, take root in the cracks and crevices of buildings, streets, and sidewalks. These species thrive in the absence of human interference, rapidly spreading and enveloping entire structures with their dense foliage.
        </p><p>
        A critical component of this overgrowth process is the role of fungi, which act as decomposers, breaking down organic matter such as wood, dead plants, and decaying debris. Species like bracket fungi and molds flourish in the damp, shaded corners of abandoned buildings, accelerating the breakdown of man-made structures. As fungi erode materials like concrete and asphalt, they contribute to the transformation of urban environments into ecosystems that support diverse plant life.
        </p><p>
        This process highlights a broader conversation about degrowth and the relationship between urbanization and the environment. According to degrowth theorists, the unchecked expansion of cities and the relentless pursuit of economic growth often come at the expense of the natural world. As urban spaces are abandoned, they serve as living examples of the potential for post-growth scenarios, where nature reclaims the land from human use. In a world where sustainability and environmental health are increasingly at the forefront of urban planning, the concept of degrowth proposes a radical rethinking of how cities interact with nature .
        </p><p>
        Plants and fungi that thrive in these forgotten spaces serve as agents of change, creating new ecosystems that reflect the resilience of life in the face of human abandonment. In New York City and other major urban centers, this phenomenon has been documented in places like abandoned subway tunnels, rooftop gardens left unattended, and derelict buildings overtaken by greenery. These spaces, once thought to be lifeless, now host a rich tapestry of plant and fungal species, providing habitats for wildlife and a glimpse into what cities might look like if humans were to disappear entirely.
        </p><p>
        This post-human urban landscape does more than offer an aesthetic contrast between decay and renewal. It forces us to confront the reality of our environmental footprint and the power of nature to reclaim its space. The spontaneous emergence of greenery in these abandoned areas suggests that while human control over the environment may be strong, it is not absolute. In the absence of maintenance and upkeep, nature continues its quiet yet powerful work of restoration, turning what was once urban into wild, thriving ecosystems.
